### About Me

`rnd30` = around 30 / Reboot New Direction  
I started my journey into software development in my early 30s â€” rebooting my career with passion and purpose.

Currently learning Python, C, and VBA.  
I aim to become a professional software engineer and create practical tools that solve real-world problems.
